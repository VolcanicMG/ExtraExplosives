EXTRA EXPLOSIVES We came to the realization that Terraria doesnâ€™t have enough explosives, so we came up with a solution! We introduce to you Extra Explosives! Extra Explosives takes old boring bombs and makes them useful again(even in the late game). We are continuously updating and working on this mod, with more explosives to come with unique properties. Check us out on Discord to voice your opinion and thoughts on bugs, balancing, and what other explosives you might like to see.

What's to come: New Bosses and More Explosives!
